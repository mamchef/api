    <h1>MAMCHEF GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>FOR PARTNERS</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 2025-09-05</p>

    <p>These General Terms and Conditions (the "Terms") govern the relationship between MamChef, operated by MB "MamChef", a company established under the laws of the Republic of Lithuania, company code 307277177, registered at Krivi≈≥ g. 5, LT-01204, Vilnius, Republic of Lithuania (the "Platform"), and a natural or legal person using the Platform to offer food for sale (the "Partner"). By registering on or using the Platform, the Partner agrees to be bound by these Terms.</p>

    <h2>NATURE OF THE PLATFORM'S ROLE</h2>

    <p>The Platform provides Partners with the ability to receive food orders from Users. These orders may either be handed directly to Users for pick-up or delivered by a third-party delivery provider, depending on the delivery method chosen by the User.</p>

    <p>For all transactions made through the Platform, the purchase of food constitutes a direct agreement (the "Sales Agreement") between the User and the Partner. If delivery is arranged, a separate agreement (the "Delivery Agreement") is formed directly between the User and the individual or entity providing the delivery service, which may be the Partner or a third party.</p>

    <p>A Sales Agreement is considered legally binding at the moment the Partner confirms the User's order and, where delivery is involved, once the delivery provider also confirms participation and the User receives an order confirmation. For collection by the User (self pick-up), the Sales Agreement is deemed concluded when the Partner accepts the order and the confirmation is sent.</p>

    <p>If the order is placed through a direct, on-premise process, the Sales Agreement comes into effect when the User places the order with the Partner and the Partner accepts it.</p>

    <p>All such agreements are established on the basis of a standard offer and acceptance principle, in accordance with applicable Lithuanian contract law. The Partner bears full legal responsibility for the preparation, safety, and quality of the food, while the delivery party assumes liability for the logistics and delivery process.</p>

    <p>The Partner appoints the Platform as its authorized commercial representative for the purpose of facilitating transactions between the Partner and Users. This includes, where relevant, delivery-related arrangements. The Partner permits the Platform to act on its behalf in managing the conclusion of Sales Agreements (and, if applicable, Delivery Agreements) with Users, including - but not limited to - handling payments such as food costs, delivery charges, and any other applicable fees payable to the Partner.</p>

    <p>The Platform is authorized to collect such payments and remit them to the Partner in accordance with these Terms. The Partner acknowledges and agrees that the User's financial obligation is considered satisfied once the payment is successfully processed by the Platform.</p>

    <p>If the Partner chooses to manage delivery of the food themselves, the User enters into a direct Delivery Agreement with the Partner. In such cases, all provisions in these Terms that apply to third-party delivery providers shall equally apply to the Partner for the purposes of the Delivery Agreement.</p>

    <p>The Partner is solely responsible for ensuring full legal compliance when providing delivery services. This includes, where applicable, requiring their staff or subcontractors to complete all mandatory training, pass relevant certifications or assessments, and maintain up-to-date permits, licenses, and other regulatory approvals as required by Lithuanian law.</p>

    <p>Additionally, the Partner must ensure that any thermal delivery bags used are clean, well-maintained, and functionally appropriate for food delivery. These must be used in a way that preserves hygiene, prevents cross-contamination, and ensures that food arrives in a safe and consumable condition.</p>

    <p>The Partner may choose to enable one or more available service models offered through the Platform, including but not limited to: delivery, takeaway (self pick-up), or other solutions as made available by the Platform. The Partner may opt into these options individually or in combination, subject to availability and technical capability.</p>

    <p>Terms specific to any given service model shall apply only if the Partner has actively chosen to use that model. The Partner will not be subject to provisions related to service models they do not use.</p>

    <p>The Platform grants the Partner full access and control over their account, including the ability to manage product listings, prices, availability, and business information. Where the Partner lists products subject to legal regulation - such as alcoholic beverages or other restricted goods - the Partner's account shall be deemed, for legal purposes, to represent the Partner's own online storefront.</p>

    <p>The Partner is solely responsible for ensuring that all listings and sales comply with applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to licensing, age restrictions, labelling, product descriptions, and advertising rules. This includes maintaining current authorisations and adhering to all restrictions applicable to the sale of alcohol or any other regulated items.</p>

    <p>The Partner authorises the Platform and/or any designated delivery providers to carry out certain regulatory checks on the Partner's behalf, including verification of the User's minimum legal age and the enforcement of legal timeframes for the sale of such goods. However, the Partner remains fully liable for any breach of legal obligations and agrees to indemnify and hold the Platform harmless from any fines, penalties, claims, or complaints arising from the sale or advertisement of regulated products.</p>

    <p>The Partner is obligated to supply the Platform with all information and supporting documentation required under applicable legal frameworks, including but not limited to EU Regulation 2022/2065 (Digital Services Act) and Council Directive 2021/514 (DAC7). The Partner must ensure that all submitted data is accurate, complete, and kept up to date at all times.</p>

    <p>In the event of any changes to the Partner's information such as legal name, business address, contact details, payment or tax information (including VAT or TIN numbers), or registration status-the Partner shall notify the Platform without undue delay and in any case provide sufficient notice for the Platform to update its internal records and comply with regulatory obligations.</p>

    <p>Failure to submit accurate or current information may result in delays in payouts, suspension of services, or other operational disruptions. To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Platform disclaims all liability for any losses, damages, or legal consequences arising from the Partner's failure to comply with this obligation.</p>

    <h2>STATUS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTNER</h2>

    <p>The Partner operates as an independent food business operator, licensed by the State Food and Veterinary Service (VMVT).</p>

    <p>The Partner confirms compliance with all applicable food laws, including hygiene, allergen labelling, and sanitary standards. The Partner bears full responsibility for the safety, accuracy, and legality of all food sold.</p>

    <p>The Partner shall indemnify and hold the Platform harmless from any claims, damages, or legal proceedings arising from foodborne illness, allergens, contamination, or other food-related issues.</p>

    <p>Partners may only register after submitting the following documents: valid VMVT license, identity/company verification, proof of bank account, and any other documents requested by the Platform. The Platform may refuse onboarding at its discretion.</p>

    <p>Partners must notify the Platform of any changes to their legal, regulatory, or operational status. Failure to maintain compliance may result in suspension or termination.</p>

    <h2>ORDERS AND SALES</h2>

    <p>Once an Order is placed by a User, the Partner is responsible for reviewing and either accepting or rejecting the Order within the response timeframe specified in the applicable service-level documentation or operational guidelines provided by the Platform.</p>

    <p>If the Partner is unable to fulfill the requested Order due to unavailability of ingredients, capacity issues, or any other reason they must not accept the Order through the Platform. In cases where automatic order acceptance is enabled, the Partner must still ensure compliance with all service-level timing and fulfilment standards as set out in the Platform's operational requirements.</p>

    <p>The Partner must actively monitor incoming Orders throughout their stated business hours on the Platform. Timely handling of Orders is a mandatory condition for continued use of the Platform, and failure to do so may result in suspension or de-prioritisation of the Partner's listings.</p>

    <h2>ORDER PERFORMANCE</h2>

    <p>The Partner must be fully prepared to begin offering their services through the Platform immediately upon the activation of their Partner account or the execution of the Agreement, unless a different start date has been explicitly agreed in writing between the parties.</p>

    <p>Specific operational standards, order-handling procedures, and response timeframes applicable to the Partner are set out in the Platform's service-level guidelines (Schedule 1) and form an integral part of these Terms.</p>

    <p>The Partner shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that all listed menu items remain available to Users during their published operating hours. In the event the Partner is unable-or anticipates being unable-to fulfil incoming Orders (due to stock shortages, equipment failure, or other interruptions), they must promptly pause order intake by setting their account to offline mode until service readiness is restored.</p>

    <p>The Partner is fully responsible for ensuring that each Order matches the User's selected items, including any applicable customisations or special instructions. Every effort must be made to honor specific requests made by Users, where operationally feasible and safe.</p>

    <p>All Orders must be prepared and made ready for pick-up whether by a delivery provider or by the User themselves-within the time limits defined in the Platform's service-level policy (Schedule 1). The Partner may activate or deactivate the self pick-up (take-away) option at their discretion, unless otherwise agreed.</p>

    <p>It is the Partner's duty to verify that the correct Order is handed to the correct courier or User. If the wrong Order is provided to a courier, the Platform may deduct the value of that Order from the Partner's upcoming payout. In cases where Orders are not completed within the required preparation time, the Platform may apply proportional deductions from the Partner's earnings, not exceeding the total price of the delayed Order.</p>

    <p>All Goods must be securely and appropriately packaged in accordance with local food safety regulations, especially when food is involved. Only properly sealed and labelled items shall be made available for collection. If a delivery service is used, the food must be suitable for transport in a thermal container. The Partner must ensure that packaging does not include any branding, logos, or promotional materials of competing platforms or third parties, unless explicitly authorised by the Platform under special terms.</p>

    <p>The Partner guarantees that all Goods offered through the Platform meet the following criteria at the time of sale:</p>

    <p><strong>Accurate Description:</strong> Products must match their descriptions as published on the Platform, including any dietary indicators such as "gluten-free," "nut-free," "vegetarian," or "vegan," where applicable. These claims must be truthful and verifiable.</p>

    <p><strong>Health and Safety:</strong> Goods must be safe for human consumption, not harmful to health or the environment, and must not include any prohibited or hazardous substances.</p>

    <p><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Products must not violate any applicable laws or regulations and must not conflict with the provisions of these Terms.</p>

    <p><strong>Proper Preparation:</strong> Where Goods involve food, they must be properly cooked, prepared, and presented in a manner that ensures hygiene, safety, and edibility. Products must be suitable for delivery-maintaining appropriate temperature, quality, and integrity during transport.</p>

    <p><strong>Packaging Standards:</strong> Goods must be packaged in compliance with all applicable laws and best practices, including durability sufficient to protect the item throughout the delivery process.</p>

    <p><strong>Visual Accuracy:</strong> The appearance of the delivered Goods should, to the greatest practical extent, reflect the photos or visual representations provided on the Platform.</p>

    <p>The Partner is obligated to immediately inform the Platform upon discovering that any product listed under their account may be unlawful, misrepresented, or otherwise non-compliant with applicable regulations. This includes, but is not limited to, food safety violations, mislabelled items, or restricted goods.</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right to conduct inspections or audits of the Partner's service operations at any time, without prior notice, to ensure compliance with these Terms, applicable laws, and food safety standards. The Partner agrees to cooperate fully with any such reviews, including providing documentation, access to preparation facilities (where applicable), and truthful responses to any inquiries.</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right to unilaterally cancel any Order placed through the Platform under the following circumstances:</p>

    <p><strong>User-Initiated Cancellation Prior to Acceptance:</strong> If the User requests cancellation before the Partner has confirmed the Order, no compensation or fees will be due to the Partner.</p>

    <p><strong>Cancellation Before Preparation Commences:</strong> If the cancellation occurs before the Partner has started preparing the Order and no preparation notification has been issued, the Partner is not entitled to any payment for the cancelled Order.</p>

    <p><strong>User-Initiated Cancellation After Acceptance But Before Preparation:</strong> If the User requests cancellation after the Order has been accepted but before preparation has begun, no fees will be paid to the Partner.</p>

    <p><strong>Cancellation During Preparation, Within Delivery Time Estimate:</strong> If the User cancels the Order after preparation has started but before the estimated delivery window has expired, the Partner is entitled to compensation only for items that required preparation. No payment will be made for pre-packaged goods (e.g. bottled drinks, shelf-stable products).</p>

    <p><strong>Cancellation After Estimated Delivery Time Has Expired:</strong> If the User cancels after preparation has started and the estimated delivery time has been exceeded, and the delay is attributable to the Partner, the Partner forfeits any right to fees for that Order. In such cases, the Platform may recover or deduct the delivery costs from the Partner's future payouts.</p>

    <p><strong>Cancellation Before Collection:</strong> If the Order is cancelled after preparation but prior to pick-up, the Partner may be compensated under Section 7 (Payment Terms), except for pre-packaged items not requiring preparation.</p>

    <p>The Platform shall determine eligibility for compensation based on system records and preparation status, and its decision shall be final.</p>

    <p>If the Partner undertakes the delivery of Orders directly, the Partner guarantees full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and safety standards governing the provision of food delivery services. This obligation extends to any employees, couriers, or subcontractors acting on the Partner's behalf.</p>

    <p>The Partner is solely responsible for ensuring that all individuals involved in the delivery process are properly trained, legally eligible, and adhere to hygiene, transport, and food safety requirements as set out by national and municipal authorities.</p>

    <p>The Platform may enable Partners to use flexible pricing models, including the sale of items priced by weight, substitution of out-of-stock items, or the application of additional charges for packaging when necessary to complete an Order.</p>

    <p>Where such models are used, the prices initially displayed to the User shall be treated as estimates. To account for potential price variations, the Platform may place a temporary pre-authorisation on the User's payment method or apply an estimated adjustment charge during checkout.</p>

    <p>Prior to dispatch or collection of the Order, the Partner must provide the Platform with the final pricing information, including the actual weight of items, additional packaging charges, or any substitutions made. This final amount must be consistent with the fiscal receipt or invoice issued to the User in accordance with applicable legal requirements.</p>

    <p>Users will only be charged for what they actually receive. If the estimated adjustment fee is insufficient to cover the final amount, the Partner is responsible for absorbing the difference. The Partner is also accountable for ensuring the accuracy of all submitted pricing and measurement data. In the event of inconsistencies, the Platform may recover or withhold any excess charges billed to the User from the Partner's payout.</p>

    <p>The Platform may, at its discretion, permit Partners to offer Users the ability to apply Partner-managed loyalty programs or benefits (such as discounts or rewards linked to a loyalty card or code) during the checkout process.</p>

    <p>The Partner is solely responsible for configuring, managing, and validating such loyalty benefits. The Platform shall not be held liable for any errors - technical or otherwise - that prevent, misapply, or inaccurately reflect these discounts.</p>

    <p>Prior to dispatch or handover of the Order, the Partner must submit the final price of the Goods - adjusted to reflect any loyalty-based discounts - to the Platform. This final price must also be accurately represented on the fiscal receipt or invoice issued to the User, in accordance with applicable legal obligations.</p>

    <p>The Platform will only charge the User the confirmed final price. The Partner accepts full liability for any discrepancies between the declared final price and the actual amount charged or receipted. Any overcharges or inconsistencies may be recovered by the Platform through deductions from the Partner's future payouts.</p>

    <h2>USE OF THE PLATFORM BY THE PARTNER</h2>

    <p>The Partner will access the Platform via a unique user account provided by the Platform operator. Each Partner is permitted to maintain only one primary account for business operations on the Platform.</p>

    <p>The login credentials and account setup details - both for the main Partner account and any associated sub-accounts - will be provided to the Partner by the Platform upon successful onboarding. The Partner is responsible for safeguarding access credentials and ensuring only authorized personnel manage the account.</p>

    <p>The Partner is solely responsible for ensuring that all activities conducted under this Agreement comply fully with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. This includes, but is not limited to, laws governing labor conditions, occupational safety, employee rights, and workplace protections.</p>

    <p>The Partner must ensure that all personnel engaged in preparing, handling, packaging, or delivering Orders-whether employees, contractors, or third parties-are treated in accordance with applicable employment laws and provided with a safe and lawful working environment.</p>

    <p>The Platform assumes no responsibility for the Partner's internal employment practices and disclaims all liability arising from any non-compliance, disputes, or claims related to the Partner's personnel or subcontractors.</p>

    <p>All content related to the Partner's business-including establishment details, product listings, menus, pricing, and operating hours-must be uploaded to the Platform directly by the Partner, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Platform operator.</p>

    <p>The Partner is fully and exclusively responsible for ensuring the accuracy, completeness, and legal compliance of all information displayed under their account. This includes, but is not limited to, product descriptions, item availability, pricing (including any applicable price reductions), and statutory disclosures.</p>

    <p>If the Partner identifies any incorrect, outdated, or misleading content-whether entered by the Partner or published by the Platform on the Partner's behalf-the Partner must promptly correct the information through the Platform or notify the Platform for rectification, as appropriate.</p>

    <p>The Partner is also required to provide all food-related data mandated by applicable law, including ingredient lists, allergen declarations, and dietary labels. Upon User request, the Partner must supply additional product information (e.g. ingredients, allergens, preparation methods) in a timely and accurate manner.</p>

    <p>Failure to maintain accurate data may result in financial penalties, customer complaints, or removal from the Platform.</p>

    <p>To access and manage Orders through the Platform, the Partner must use a compatible device. The Partner may either use its own equipment or obtain a device from the Platform, subject to a purchase or rental agreement.</p>

    <p>Where devices are rented, the Platform reserves the right to require a security deposit from the Partner. The Partner is responsible for keeping all rented equipment-including any tablets, printers, or accessories-in good working condition and ensuring it is used solely for the intended business purposes.</p>

    <p>Upon termination of the Partner's relationship with the Platform, any rented or loaned devices must be returned promptly and in proper working order, accounting for normal wear and tear. The Platform may provide specific instructions regarding the method and timeframe for the return of equipment.</p>

    <p>If the Partner fails to return any rented devices or other equipment as required, the Platform may either retain the deposit (if applicable) or impose a contractual penalty equal to the replacement value of the unreturned items.</p>

    <p>Maintenance or replacement of rented devices shall be agreed upon between the parties as needed. The Partner must notify the Platform promptly in the event of malfunction or damage.</p>

    <p>The Platform does not guarantee uninterrupted access or flawless technical performance on any specific device, operating system, or software environment. No obligation is assumed by the Platform to provide ongoing or on-demand technical support for device compatibility or operational issues.</p>

    <p>The Partner is responsible for ensuring that all Platform-provided updates, patches, modules, or software upgrades are installed and properly implemented without delay. Failure to do so may result in degraded performance or limited access to Platform features.</p>

    <p>The Platform shall not be held liable for any direct or indirect loss, business interruption, or missed revenue arising from the Partner's failure to comply with this obligation or from any technical issues outside the Platform's control.</p>

    <p>The Partner must apply generally accepted best practices in information technology and cybersecurity to prevent the introduction of viruses, malware, or other harmful code into the Platform.</p>

    <p>If the Partner through action or negligence causes or contributes to the introduction of any virus or similar threat to the Platform, the Partner shall, at its own expense:</p>

    <p>Cooperate fully with the Platform to mitigate, contain, and eliminate the issue;</p>

    <p>Provide all reasonable technical assistance required to restore the integrity of the Platform;</p>

    <p>Compensate the Platform for all direct and indirect losses, costs, or damages incurred as a result, including but not limited to system repairs, security interventions, data loss recovery, and service disruptions.</p>

    <p>This obligation applies regardless of whether the breach was caused by the Partner's staff, contractors, or systems.</p>

    <p>Users may submit feedback or lodge complaints regarding their Orders directly through the Platform. If a complaint concerns specific Goods, the User must submit it within the following timeframes:</p>

    <p>Within 48 hours of delivery for perishable items;</p>

    <p>Within 30 days of delivery for non-perishable goods;</p>

    <p>At any time following delivery for complaints involving potential food safety risks or health-related concerns.</p>

    <p>The Platform will review complaints and determine appropriate actions at its sole discretion. Acting in good faith, the Platform may choose to issue a full or partial refund to the User and, where applicable, recover the refunded amount from the Partner.</p>

    <p>If the Partner becomes the subject of repeated or serious complaints-especially those relating to product quality, food safety, or customer treatment-the Platform reserves the right to temporarily suspend or permanently remove the Partner from the Platform.</p>

    <p>The Platform may establish and update a formal Complaints and Refund Policy, which shall be considered an integral part of these Terms. The Partner is required to comply fully with the provisions of that policy as a condition of continued participation on the Platform.</p>

    <p>The Partner is responsible for providing high-quality, high-resolution images to represent its Goods on the Platform. All images must accurately reflect the items being offered and meet professional standards suitable for digital display.</p>

    <p>If any submitted photos are blurry, low resolution, misleading, or do not meet the Platform's quality or content requirements, the Platform reserves the right to reject such images and request revised submissions.</p>

    <p>Alternatively, the Platform may, at its sole discretion, upload substitute images of equivalent or similar appearance to ensure the visual consistency and user experience of the Platform. The Partner acknowledges that the Platform has the final say regarding which images are displayed.</p>

    <p>The Platform operator reserves the right to modify, suspend, or permanently discontinue any part of the Platform or its services-either in full or in part-at any time and for any reason. This includes, but is not limited to, the introduction of new features, the removal of existing functionalities, or adjustments to the Platform's structure, interface, or content delivery.</p>

    <p>Such changes may be implemented with or without prior notice, at the discretion of the Platform. However, the Platform will make reasonable efforts to inform Partners of material changes or the discontinuation of key functionalities that may affect their ability to operate through the Platform.</p>

    <p>The Partner acknowledges and accepts that continued use of the Platform constitutes agreement to any modifications introduced.</p>

    <p>All content published by the Partner on the Platform-including product descriptions, images, pricing, and business information-is the sole responsibility of the Partner. The Platform does not have a general obligation to monitor, verify, or proactively review such content, in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (Digital Services Act).</p>

    <p>However, upon receiving a valid notification or credible report that any content may be unlawful or in violation of these Terms, the Platform reserves the right to remove, disable, or restrict access to such content at its sole discretion and without prior Partner approval.</p>

    <p>If the Partner disagrees with a removal decision, they may contest it through the Platform's internal complaint-handling procedure. The burden of proof lies with the Partner to demonstrate that the disputed content is lawful and compliant with these Terms.</p>

    <p>For any Goods subject to the General Product Safety Regulation (EU) 2023/988, the Partner is solely responsible for ensuring full compliance with all applicable safety, labelling, and consumer information obligations.</p>

    <p>This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

    <p>Providing accurate and complete product labels;</p>

    <p>Including safety instructions and warnings as required by law;</p>

    <p>Ensuring product traceability;</p>

    <p>Clearly disclosing manufacturer or importer details;</p>

    <p>Displaying all relevant product identifiers.</p>

    <p>All mandatory safety and regulatory information must also be accurately presented on the Platform as part of the Partner's product listings. Failure to comply with these obligations may result in the suspension or removal of the relevant Goods and/or the Partner's access to the Platform.</p>

    <p>If any content, data, or information provided by the Partner is determined-either by the Platform, competent authority, or credible third-party notice-to be illegal under applicable law or in breach of these Terms, the Platform reserves the right to take one or more of the following actions, at its sole discretion and without prior notice:</p>

    <p>Remove or disable access to the offending content;</p>

    <p>Suspend or restrict the Partner's ability to upload or modify content on the Platform;</p>

    <p>Temporarily or permanently suspend the Partner's access to the Platform;</p>

    <p>Report the content and the Partner to relevant regulatory or enforcement authorities, if legally required or appropriate;</p>

    <p>Withhold payouts related to the disputed content until the matter is resolved;</p>

    <p>Initiate internal investigation or request further clarifications from the Partner;</p>

    <p>Terminate the Agreement, in cases of repeated or serious violations.</p>

    <p>The Partner shall have the right to respond and, if applicable, provide evidence supporting the legality or compliance of the content through the Platform's internal dispute or complaint process.</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right to temporarily suspend a Partner's ability to submit complaints or notices through its internal complaint-handling mechanism if the Partner repeatedly submits claims that are clearly unfounded or abusive in nature.</p>

    <p>Such suspension will only occur after the Platform has provided the Partner with a written warning, outlining the concerns and giving the Partner an opportunity to respond.</p>

    <p>When evaluating whether a suspension is warranted, the Platform may consider, among other factors:</p>

    <p>The frequency of unfounded or repetitive complaints;</p>

    <p>The nature and content of the submissions, including whether they appear intentionally misleading, obstructive, or abusive;</p>

    <p>The impact of the submissions on the efficiency and effectiveness of the complaint-handling system;</p>

    <p>The Partner's previous conduct, including any past warnings or instances of misuse;</p>

    <p>Any indication of bad faith or deliberate misuse of the procedure.</p>

    <p>Suspension shall be limited to a reasonable period of time and shall not affect the Partner's ability to operate on the Platform unless otherwise determined under these Terms.</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right to suspend the Partner's access to its services for a reasonable period of time if the Partner is found to be repeatedly submitting content or information that is manifestly illegal under applicable law.</p>

    <p>Such suspension may only be imposed after the Partner has received prior written warning and has been given an opportunity to respond or correct the identified issues.</p>

    <p>In determining whether suspension is appropriate, the Platform will take into account:</p>

    <p>The severity and potential consequences of the unlawful or false information submitted by the Partner;</p>

    <p>The specific nature of the illegal content involved (e.g. health risks, fraud, consumer deception);</p>

    <p>The Partner's intent, where relevant-whether the submission was made negligently, knowingly, or maliciously.</p>

    <p>Any suspension under this clause shall be proportionate to the circumstances and may be lifted once the Partner demonstrates full compliance with the applicable laws and these Terms.</p>

    <p>As part of the services provided through the Platform, the Platform operator may, at its sole discretion, grant the Partner access to a dedicated Partner Portal. This portal allows the Partner to manage and update information displayed on their specific section of the Platform, including but not limited to menus, prices, operating hours, and business details.</p>

    <p>Access to the Partner Portal is a privilege and not a guaranteed feature. The Platform reserves the right to revoke or restrict this access at any time-temporarily or permanently-without prior notice, particularly in cases of misuse, non-compliance with these Terms, or technical or operational concerns.</p>

    <p>The Partner is fully responsible for the accuracy and legality of all content submitted via the Partner Portal and must ensure all updates comply with applicable laws and Platform policies:</p>

    <p>The Partner acknowledges and accepts full responsibility for managing access rights to the Partner Portal granted to its representatives or staff. This includes the authority to assign, modify, restrict, or revoke access permissions at any time.</p>

    <p>By authorizing a representative to use the Partner Portal, the Partner expressly permits that individual to act on its behalf, including but not limited to the ability to:</p>

    <p>Edit menus and Goods Prices;</p>

    <p>Configure promotional campaigns and special offers;</p>

    <p>View active and historical Orders;</p>

    <p>Manage other user accounts and grant further access;</p>

    <p>Adjust operational settings or preferences as permitted by the portal.</p>

    <p>The Partner shall bear full legal and financial responsibility for any actions taken within the Partner Portal by its authorized representatives and must ensure that only trusted, properly trained individuals are granted such access.</p>

    <h2>PAYMENTS AND FEES</h2>

    <p>The Platform shall collect payments from Users on behalf of the Partner and shall deduct applicable fees and charges in accordance with these Terms and any supplemental documentation or Addendum incorporated herein.</p>

    <p>In consideration for the Platform's mediation services in facilitating Sales Agreements between the Partner and Users, the Partner agrees to pay a Platform Fee for each Order placed through the Platform, excluding any voluntary Tips provided by the User.</p>

    <p>The Platform Fee shall be calculated as a fixed Agreed Percentage of the total net revenue (excluding VAT or other applicable taxes) earned by the Partner for all eligible Orders completed during the relevant settlement period.</p>

    <p>The specific percentage and payment terms shall be set out in the Partner's commercial terms, onboarding documentation, or within a dynamic Addendum made available through the Platform's dashboard or Partner portal. The Platform reserves the right to adjust the Platform Fee in accordance with Clause 5.3.</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify the Agreed Percentage used to calculate the Platform Fee, or to otherwise amend these Payment Terms, by providing written notice (including electronic notification through the Platform or Partner portal) at least thirty (30) days in advance of the effective date.</p>

    <p>If the Partner does not accept the revised terms, it may terminate the Agreement by written notice within such thirty (30) day period. In that case, the current Payment Terms shall continue to apply until termination takes effect, even if the termination date falls after the new terms would otherwise have taken effect.</p>

    <p>If the Partner does not submit such termination notice within the thirty (30) day period, the Partner shall be deemed to have accepted the revised terms and will be bound by them from the effective date specified in the notice.</p>

    <p>In addition to the Platform Fee, the Partner agrees to pay Service Fees for any device(s), equipment, or software provided by the Platform, where applicable. These may include rental, maintenance, or licensing fees, as specified in the applicable pricing or rental agreement or in a dynamic Addendum provided through the Platform.</p>

    <p>The Platform may also charge the Partner a Marketing Fee for promotional or advertising campaigns. Such campaigns and related costs shall be agreed in writing between the Platform and the Partner, including via electronic acceptance on the Platform's Partner portal.</p>

    <p>All applicable fees may be deducted directly from the Partner's payouts unless otherwise agreed.</p>

    <p>All fees, charges, and commissions payable under these Terms are exclusive of VAT or any other applicable taxes. VAT, where applicable, will be added at the prevailing statutory rate. The Partner remains solely responsible for accounting for and remitting any taxes due under applicable law, unless otherwise expressly stated in a separate agreement.</p>

    <p>Where the Partner undertakes deliveries directly, it shall be entitled to a Delivery Fee for each completed delivery made through the Platform.</p>

    <p>If an Order is below the Minimum Order Value set by the Platform, a Small Order Fee shall be charged to the User and transferred to the Partner in addition to the Delivery Fee.</p>

    <p>All delivery-related fees will be paid to the Partner's designated bank account. The Partner is exclusively responsible for distributing such fees to its employees, agents, or contractors, and the Platform shall bear no liability for such arrangements.</p>

    <p>The Platform may withhold payment to the Partner in the event of a dispute until the matter has been resolved.</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right to adjust or withhold payouts in cases of fraud, non-compliance, or customer complaints.</p>

    <p>The Partner shall be under a binding obligation to duly complete onboarding with any third-party payment service provider designated by the Platform (including, without limitation, Stripe) for payment processing. Failure to complete onboarding shall prevent the execution of payouts, and the Partner shall have no claim against the Platform in respect of unpaid amounts arising from such failure.</p>

    <p>Dynamic Incorporation of Addendum. The Platform may issue, amend, or supplement these Payment Terms through dynamic Addendum, Partner onboarding documentation, or electronic publication via the Platform's dashboard or Partner portal. Such Addendum shall be deemed an integral part of these Terms and shall be binding on the Partner from the effective date specified therein, subject to any notice and termination rights provided under Clause 5.3.</p>

    <h2>PLATFORM RIGHTS AND CONTENT</h2>

    <p>The Platform may change or discontinue functionality at any time without prior notice. Continued use constitutes acceptance of such changes.</p>

    <p>The Platform has the right to suspend or remove Partners for violations of these Terms, applicable law, or for reputational risk.</p>

    <p>The Partner grants the Platform a non-exclusive license to use its name, logo, menu, and photos for promotional and operational purposes.</p>

    <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>

    <p>All disputes will be handled internally by the Platform. Partners agree to cooperate fully in dispute resolution.</p>

    <p>No payments will be released during the dispute process.</p>

    <h2>INVOICES</h2>

    <p>The Partner is solely responsible for issuing valid fiscal receipts to the User (or invoices to business clients, if applicable) for all charges related to the sale of Goods. This includes, but is not limited to, the Goods Price, Tips, packaging fees, and any other applicable charges, in accordance with all relevant tax and fiscal regulations.</p>

    <p>Receipts must be provided in a format compliant with applicable law and must accompany the Goods-either physically delivered with the Order or included in the packaging.</p>

    <p>The Platform may, as an additional courtesy, generate and provide the User with an informational summary of charges (a non-fiscal receipt) on behalf of the Partner. This summary does not replace the Partner's legal obligation to issue valid tax documentation.</p>

    <p>Where the Partner is responsible for delivering the Order, the Platform-acting solely as the Partner's commercial agent-may prepare and issue invoices to the User on the Partner's behalf for delivery-related charges, including the Delivery Fee, Small Order Fee, Tips, and any other applicable costs.</p>

    <p>The Platform agrees to transfer to the Partner the amounts paid by Users for all successfully completed and delivered (or collected) Orders processed through the Platform during the applicable reference period, except where the Goods Price has been paid directly by the User or Delivery Partner to the Partner.</p>

    <p>In such cases, the Partner is responsible for remitting the corresponding Platform Fee to the Platform for the relevant period.</p>

    <p>All payouts from the Platform to the Partner are subject to deduction of any outstanding amounts owed by the Partner, which may include, but are not limited to:</p>

    <p>The Platform Fee;</p>

    <p>Any refunds issued to Users by the Platform;</p>

    <p>Applicable taxes or levies collected or withheld by law;</p>

    <p>Any third-party payments collected by the Partner on behalf of another party (e.g., Delivery Partner);</p>

    <p>Penalties or fines imposed for breach of contract or operational standards;</p>

    <p>Service Fees for use of devices or software;</p>

    <p>Any other charges, fees, or withholdings as agreed between the parties.</p>

    <p>The Partner acknowledges that these deductions may be applied automatically to payouts and that the Platform's calculation and documentation of such deductions shall be considered final, unless manifestly incorrect.</p>

    <p>Unless otherwise specified in the Partner's Specific Conditions, the standard reference period for invoicing and settlement between the parties shall be one calendar week.</p>

    <p>At the end of each reference period, the Platform will process the relevant payments, applying all applicable deductions, and transfer the resulting balance to the Partner or, where appropriate, collect amounts owed by the Partner.</p>

    <p>Should any reconciliation be required-whether due to corrections, adjustments, or delayed transactions-such amounts will be identified and, where agreed, settled in the next payment cycle.</p>

    <p>Both parties agree to cooperate in good faith to identify and resolve reconciliation needs in a timely manner. Reconciliations may relate to misapplied deductions, refunds, fee errors, or other valid payment discrepancies.</p>

    <p>Within three (3) business days following the end of each reference period, the Platform will issue an electronic invoice to the Partner detailing the Platform Fee, Service Fees, and any other charges payable by the Partner for that period.</p>

    <p>If, during the same reference period, the Platform is required to make a net payment to the Partner, the Partner shall issue a corresponding invoice to the Platform, reflecting the amount due and referencing the applicable reference period.</p>

    <p>All invoices must comply with applicable tax and accounting regulations and be submitted in a format acceptable to the receiving party. The failure of either party to issue an invoice in a timely manner shall not affect the obligation to settle valid amounts due.</p>

    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, all financial obligations between the Platform and the Partner shall be settled through set-off, whereby any amounts owed by one party to the other will be automatically offset against each other.</p>

    <p>Only the net balance, if any, remaining after such offsetting shall be paid. In cases where offsetting is not possible-either in full or in part-any outstanding amounts shall be settled via bank transfer to the account designated by the receiving party.</p>

    <p>Each party agrees to maintain accurate and up-to-date bank account details and to facilitate prompt settlement of any non-offsettable balances</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to restrict payments of the Goods Price from being made to the Partner by the Delivery Partner.</p>

    <p>For Orders designated as self pick-up, where the Partner has opted into this option, the payment obligation between the User and the Partner may be settled directly at the time of collection, using any method accepted by the Partner.</p>

    <p>The Partner remains solely responsible for ensuring the proper collection, recording, and reporting of any cash received directly, and the Platform bears no liability in connection with such transactions.</p>

    <p>Any outstanding principal amount owed by the Partner to the Platform must be paid in full without delay upon receipt of a written notice or invoice from the Platform specifying the amount due.</p>

    <p>Unless otherwise agreed in writing, such payment shall be made by bank transfer to the account designated by the Platform and within the time frame stated in the notification. Failure to settle outstanding amounts in a timely manner may result in suspension of services or additional enforcement measures as permitted under these Terms.</p>

    <p>If the Partner fails to make any payment as required under these Terms-specifically including any amount due under Section 8.10-it shall be liable to pay interest on the overdue amount at a rate of 0.5% per day, calculated on the full outstanding balance until paid in full.</p>

    <p>In addition, the Partner agrees to reimburse the Platform for all reasonable costs incurred in pursuing the recovery of overdue amounts. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

    <p>Fees charged by debt collection agencies;</p>

    <p>Administrative and legal expenses;</p>

    <p>Any other documented enforcement or recovery costs.</p>

    <p>A minimum charge of EUR 15 shall apply to cover basic administrative handling, regardless of the total recovery costs incurred.</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right to disclose and share the Partner's data-including the fact and amount of any outstanding debts, and other relevant contractual or financial information-with debt collection agencies, credit reference services, and third-party debt management providers for the purpose of:</p>

    <p>Recovering unpaid amounts under this Agreement;</p>

    <p>Publishing or processing debt-related data in commercial or legal databases of debtors;</p>

    <p>Facilitating the management, enforcement, or assignment of receivables;</p>

    <p>Supporting credit risk assessments or credit decision-making processes.</p>

    <p>By entering into this Agreement, the Partner expressly consents to such disclosure where permitted by applicable law. The Partner acknowledges that such actions may have consequences on its credit rating or access to financial services.</p>

    <p>The Platform offers payment processing capabilities to the Partner as part of the services provided through the Platform. These functionalities may be modified, limited, or temporarily interrupted from time to time due to maintenance, technical issues, or operational requirements.</p>

    <p>If the Platform integrates with third-party payment service providers, the Partner acknowledges that such providers operate independently. The Platform bears no responsibility for their services, performance, or any fees or charges imposed by those third parties.</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right to suspend or revoke the Partner's access to payment functionalities without prior notice if:</p>

    <p>Required by payment processors or financial institutions;</p>

    <p>Necessary to comply with card network or regulatory obligations;</p>

    <p>There is a suspected violation of these Terms, fraud, or misuse;</p>

    <p>The Platform deems such action reasonably necessary to protect its systems or business integrity.</p>

    <p>The Partner remains solely responsible for any consequences arising from such suspension, including the inability to receive or process payments during the period of restriction.</p>

    <p>The Partner is required to provide a valid payout method registered in the Partner's own name, along with accurate billing and identification details, during onboarding. If the Partner is a legal entity, it must submit all relevant corporate information, including tax identification numbers and legal representative details, as applicable.</p>

    <p>The Partner is solely responsible for keeping all payment-related information accurate and up to date. The Platform may, at its discretion, request additional documentation to verify identity, ownership of the payout account, or to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.</p>

    <p>All payouts will be made using the most recent details provided by the Partner. The Platform shall not be liable for any delays, misdirected payments, or losses resulting from incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated payment information.</p>

    <p>If the Platform is unable to complete a payout due to missing or incorrect details, the affected funds will be held for a maximum of 180 days. If the Partner fails to submit valid and complete payout details within this period, the Partner's right to claim the withheld funds shall expire, and the Platform shall have no further obligation to disburse the amount.</p>

    <h2>AGREEMENT TERM, TERMINATION, SUSPENSION</h2>

    <p>This Agreement is concluded for an indefinite period, unless a fixed term is expressly specified in the applicable Partner Specific Conditions. The Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated by either party in accordance with these Terms.</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to temporarily suspend, delist specific Goods, or immediately terminate this Agreement-without prior notice and without any obligation to compensate the Partner for lost profits, if:</p>

    <p>The Partner breaches any material obligation under this Agreement;</p>

    <p>The Partner violates any applicable law or regulatory requirement;</p>

    <p>The Partner engages in conduct that, in the Platform's reasonable judgment, may harm or discredit the Platform's brand, business reputation, or commercial interests;</p>

    <p>The Partner disparages the Platform or its services in a public or professional capacity;</p>

    <p>The Platform has reasonable grounds to suspect the Partner has engaged in fraudulent, deceptive, or unethical activity in connection with use of the Platform.</p>

    <p>The Partner acknowledges that these measures are necessary to protect the integrity, security, and reputation of the Platform and its users.</p>

    <p>The Partner may terminate this Agreement at any time without cause, provided that a written notice is submitted to the Platform at least 30 days in advance.</p>

    <p>The Platform may also terminate the Agreement at any time, by providing the Partner with a reasoned notice at least 30 days prior to the effective termination date.</p>

    <p>However, the Platform shall not be required to give advance notice of termination if:</p>

    <p>The Partner has committed a serious or repeated breach of this Agreement;</p>

    <p>The Platform has reasonable grounds to suspect fraudulent or unlawful activity by the Partner;</p>

    <p>Immediate termination is required to ensure compliance with applicable law, regulatory obligations, or card scheme rules;</p>

    <p>Continued access by the Partner would pose a security or reputational risk to the Platform or its users.</p>

    <p>In such cases, the Agreement may be terminated with immediate effect, and the Platform shall not be liable for any resulting losses, including loss of revenue or goodwill.</p>

    <p>The Partner shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect-without observing any notice period-if the Platform repeatedly and materially breaches its obligations under these General Terms and fails to remedy such breach within a reasonable time following a written notice from the Partner.</p>

    <p>This right of extraordinary termination shall apply only where the Platform's non-compliance is substantial, ongoing, and has a material impact on the Partner's ability to operate through the Platform.</p>

    <p>The termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not affect:</p>

    <p>Any rights or claims that have accrued to either party prior to the termination date, including the right to receive or recover any payments due but not yet paid; and</p>

    <p>Any obligations or provisions of this Agreement that are expressly stated-or by their nature are intended-to survive termination, including but not limited to clauses related to payments, liability, dispute resolution, and confidentiality.</p>

    <p>If the Agreement is terminated with immediate effect by either party and there is an ongoing offline marketing campaign (such as printed materials, billboards, or physical advertisements) that includes the Partner or any of the Partner's establishments, the Platform shall have the right to continue using such materials without modification for the duration of the campaign.</p>

    <p>The Partner acknowledges that due to the nature of offline campaigns, it may not be technically or commercially feasible to alter or remove materials immediately. Accordingly, the Platform shall not be obligated to recall, reprint, or replace existing campaign materials featuring the Partner, and no compensation shall be due to the Partner as a result.</p>

    <h2>LICENSING, DATA PROCESSING, AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS</h2>

    <p>The Platform grants the Partner a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to access and use the Platform solely for the purpose of:</p>

    <p>Offering and selling Goods to Users via the Platform; and</p>

    <p>Where applicable, facilitating deliveries when such services are performed directly by the Partner.</p>

    <p>This license is granted only for the duration of the Agreement and is subject to the Partner's full compliance with all applicable terms, laws, and policies. The license may be withdrawn by the Platform at any time, in whole or in part, at its sole discretion.</p>

    <p>By entering into this Agreement, the Partner grants the Platform a royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, and sub-licensable license to use, reproduce, distribute, translate, adapt, modify, publicly display, and otherwise exploit any Partner Content (including names, logos, menus, product descriptions, and images) for the purposes of operating, marketing, improving, or expanding the Platform's services-unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>

    <p>This license shall remain valid for the full duration of intellectual property protection applicable to the relevant content.</p>

    <p>It holds all necessary intellectual property rights or has obtained lawful authorization to use and license the submitted materials;</p>

    <p>Its use of trademarks, business names, product images, or other content on the Platform does not infringe any third-party rights, including copyrights or trademarks.</p>

    <p>If any product photos or visual assets are created by or at the expense of the Platform (including photographers or contractors engaged by the Platform), then all associated rights, including copyright and usage rights, shall vest exclusively in the Platform.</p>

    <p>Where the Partner purchases a license to use such photos, the Partner is granted a limited right to use the photos for any lawful purpose, except for use on competing platforms or in connection with services that are identical or substantially similar to those offered through the Platform.</p>

    <p>All intellectual property rights in and to the Platform software, technical infrastructure, documentation, and any materials developed by or on behalf of the Platform in connection with the services-whether existing prior to or created during the term of this Agreement-shall remain the exclusive property of the Platform. This includes, without limitation:</p>

    <p>The Platform interface and software;</p>

    <p>All related systems, tools, and technologies;</p>

    <p>Confidential Information;</p>

    <p>Photos of Goods, where such content was created or commissioned by the Platform;</p>

    <p>All data, analytics, and sales statistics derived from Partner activity on the Platform.</p>

    <p>The Partner is strictly prohibited from engaging in any of the following activities, whether directly or indirectly:</p>

    <p>Copying, modifying, or adapting the Platform or its components;</p>

    <p>Reverse-engineering, decompiling, or attempting to access or reproduce the source code;</p>

    <p>Using the Platform software or any related technology for any purpose other than as permitted by this Agreement.</p>

    <p>The Platform will retain and maintain sales-related data and statistics for each reference period for a period of one (1) year following the end of the applicable period, after which such data may be archived or deleted at the Platform's discretion.</p>

    <p>The Partner is strictly prohibited from engaging in any form of unauthorized data collection from the Platform. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>

    <p>Data scraping, data mining, or data extraction;</p>

    <p>Use of bots, spiders, crawlers, or automated scripts to collect or access information;</p>

    <p>Manual or automated techniques intended to access, retrieve, copy, or compile any data hosted on or generated by the Platform, including content related to Users, orders, pricing, or operational metrics.</p>

    <p>Any such activity constitutes a material breach of this Agreement and may result in immediate suspension or termination of the Partner's access, in addition to legal remedies available to the Platform.</p>

    <p>The Partner agrees not to facilitate, authorize, or allow any third party to perform such prohibited actions on its behalf or using its access credentials.</p>

    <p>The specific terms and conditions governing the processing and sharing of personal data relating to Users (Clients) and Delivery Partners are outlined in Schedule 2 (Data Sharing Agreement), which forms an integral part of this Agreement.</p>

    <p>Both parties agree to comply with the terms set forth in Schedule 2, including all data protection obligations under applicable privacy laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR) and any relevant local data protection legislation.</p>

    <h2>Legal and Final Provisions</h2>

    <p>During the term of this Agreement and for a period of five (5) years following its termination or expiration, both the Platform and the Partner agree to treat as strictly confidential all Confidential Information received from the other party.</p>

    <p>Neither party shall disclose, share, or otherwise make available any such Confidential Information to any third party without the prior written consent of the disclosing party, except where required by law, regulation, or court order.</p>

    <p>Each party shall implement and maintain reasonable safeguards to prevent unauthorized use, disclosure, or access to such information, and shall use it solely for the purpose of performing obligations under this Agreement.</p>

    <p>Confidential Information belonging to one party may be disclosed to third parties only with the prior written consent of the disclosing party.</p>

    <p>Legal advisors or attorneys;</p>

    <p>Auditors or accountants;</p>

    <p>Professional consultants; or</p>

    <p>Subcontractors or service providers</p>

    <p>provided that:</p>

    <p>The disclosure is strictly necessary for fulfilling obligations under this Agreement; and</p>

    <p>The recipients are bound by confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those set forth in this Agreement.</p>

    <p>The receiving party remains fully responsible for any breach of confidentiality by such third parties.</p>

    <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Lithuania.</p>

    <p>Any disputes arising from these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of Lithuanian courts.</p>

    <p>The Platform may amend these Terms unilaterally at any time. Continued use of the Platform implies acceptance of updated Terms.</p>

    <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid, the remainder shall remain in force.</p>

    <h2>ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING AND SANCTIONS COMPLIANCE</h2>

    <p>The Partner represents and warrants that it is and will remain in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to:</p>

    <p>Anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF);</p>

    <p>Sanctions and embargo laws;</p>

    <p>Export control and foreign trade regulations;</p>

    <p>Prohibitions against dealings with designated or restricted parties.</p>

    <p>The Partner further warrants that neither it, nor any of its affiliates, shareholders, directors, officers, or ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs), are subject to any sanctions or listed on any watchlists maintained by international or governmental authorities (including the European Union, United Nations, U.S. OFAC, or other relevant bodies).</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right to carry out compliance reviews, audits, and risk assessments of the Partner at any time to verify adherence to applicable AML and sanctions regulations.

    <p>Immediately suspend the Partner's access to the Platform;</p>

    <p>Withhold payouts or other financial settlements;</p>

    <p>Report findings to competent authorities, where legally required.</p>

    <h2>MISCELLANEOUS</h2>

    <p>Where the Partner uses the Platform to offer and sell Goods within a Member State of the European Union or the European Economic Area, any termination of this Agreement or suspension of the Partner's access to the Platform that materially affects the Partner's ability to operate shall be subject to the additional requirements and safeguards provided under Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council on promoting fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services.</p>

    <p>In such cases, the Platform shall comply with its obligations under the Regulation, including requirements concerning:</p>

    <p>Advance notice of termination or restriction of services (unless exceptions apply);</p>

    <p>Statement of reasons for suspension or termination;</p>

    <p>The Partner's right to submit complaints through the internal complaint-handling mechanism;</p>

    <p>Availability of mediation procedures, where applicable.</p>

    <p>This clause shall apply only to Partners operating in jurisdictions covered by the Regulation and solely in respect of activities governed by it.</p>

    <p>In accordance with Regulation (EU) 2022/2065 (Digital Services Act) and Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 (Platform-to-Business Regulation), any Partner operating in a Member State of the European Union or European Economic Area, as referenced in Section 3.4, shall have the right to challenge decisions made by the Platform, including but not limited to:</p>

    <p>All such challenges shall be submitted in accordance with the Platform's Internal Complaint-Handling System Rules, which are publicly available at www.mamchef.com</p>

    <p>In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of this Agreement and its related documents, the following order of precedence shall apply (in descending order):</p>

    <p>Partner Specific Conditions (if applicable);</p>

    <p>Special Terms or Addenda (if applicable);</p>

    <p>These General Terms and Conditions;</p>

    <p>Annexes, Schedules, or Attachments;</p>

    <p>Any other document incorporated by reference into this Agreement.</p>

    <p>To the extent possible, all documents shall be interpreted in a manner that gives full effect to each without conflict. However, in case of direct contradiction, the higher-ranking document shall prevail.</p>

    <p>All notices, requests, consents, approvals, and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be delivered by the Partner via registered mail, recognized courier service, or email-provided that delivery can be verified by proof of receipt.</p>

    <p>Such communications shall be deemed effective:</p>

    <p>On the date of delivery, if sent by registered mail or courier with delivery confirmation; or</p>

    <p>On the date of successful transmission, if sent by email and confirmed by a read receipt or other acknowledgment of receipt.</p>

    <p>Each party is responsible for keeping its contact information up to date. Any failure to notify the other party of changes may result in communications being deemed properly delivered to the last known address or email.</p>

    <p>This Agreement may be made available in multiple languages for convenience. However, in the event of any discrepancy, inconsistency, or conflict between the English version and any translated version, the English version shall prevail and be deemed the authoritative and binding text for interpretation and enforcement purposes.</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right to modify or update these General Terms at any time by publishing the revised version on its official website or Partner portal. The Partner will be notified of such changes at least thirty (30) days in advance of their effective date.</p>

    <p>If the Partner does not accept the revised General Terms, it must notify the Platform in writing prior to the effective date in order to terminate the Agreement and cease using the Platform.</p>

    <p>Failure to provide such notice and continued use of the Platform-including but not limited to uploading additional Goods or accepting new Orders during the notice period-shall constitute the Partner's express acceptance of the updated terms and a waiver of the remaining notice period.</p>

    <p>The Platform shall have the right to assign or transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any of its affiliates or a third party, without requiring the prior consent of the Partner. Such assignment shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the Agreement.</p>

    <h2>ACCESS TO PLATFORM DATA</h2>

    <p>In addition to the categories of personal data outlined in Schedule 2 of these General Terms, the Platform may collect, access, and process additional non-sensitive data related to Users and Clients in the course of providing its services. Such data may include, but is not limited to:</p>

    <p>Details of Orders placed, including itemized contents;</p>

    <p>User interaction data, such as screen visits or navigation flows within the Platform;</p>

    <p>Search queries entered by Users in the Platform's search functionality;</p>

    <p>Ratings and reviews submitted by Clients regarding the Partner's Goods or services.</p>

    <p>Where appropriate, the Platform may share certain anonymized or aggregated data with the Partner for operational purposes. This may include, for example:</p>

    <p>Weekly sales summaries and statistics;</p>

    <p>Client feedback and rating trends associated with the Partner's account.</p>

    <p>The Partner acknowledges and agrees that:</p>

    <p>While the Platform makes reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of such reports and data,</p>

    <p>There may be occasional discrepancies, technical issues, or delays that affect the completeness or correctness of the information presented;</p>

    <p>Such reports are provided for informational purposes only and are not guaranteed to be error-free.</p>

    <p>The Platform shall not be liable for any loss or damage arising from reliance on such data, except in cases of proven gross negligence or willful misconduct.</p>

    <h2>SCHEDULE 1</h2>
    <h3>SERVICE LEVEL REQUIREMENTS</h3>

    <p>The Service Level Requirements set out in Schedule 1 form an integral part of this Agreement and shall apply to the Partner's performance of all activities related to:</p>

    <p>Preparation and timely handling of Orders; and</p>

    <p>Where applicable, the production and packaging of Goods intended for delivery or pickup.</p>

    <p>The Partner agrees to comply with all obligations specified in the Service Level Requirements, and acknowledges that repeated or material failure to meet such standards may result in deductions, penalties, or suspension in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

    <h3>ORDER ACCEPTANCE</h3>

    <p>Upon receipt of an Order notification through the Platform, the Partner shall confirm or reject the Order within a maximum of five (5) minutes, unless a different response time has been explicitly communicated by the Platform.</p>

    <p>If the Order auto-acceptance feature is enabled, all incoming Orders will be automatically accepted on behalf of the Partner, and the Partner shall ensure that it is operationally prepared to fulfill such Orders in accordance with the applicable service standards.</p>

    <p>Failure to adhere to the confirmation timeframes may result in service-level deductions or penalties as defined in this Agreement or applicable schedules.</p>

    <p>If the Partner is unable to fulfill an Order in accordance with the specifications provided by the Client (e.g. due to unavailability of Goods, operational issues, or any other reason), the Partner:</p>

    <p>Shall not confirm the Order on the Platform; and</p>

    <p>If the Order has already been accepted, shall immediately notify the Platform via the designated functionality, so that the Order may be cancelled without delay.</p>

    <p>In such cases:</p>

    <p>The Partner shall not be entitled to any fees or compensation under Section 5 of the General Terms; and</p>

    <p>The Platform reserves the right to charge the Partner for any delivery costs incurred, including costs borne by a Delivery Partner who attempted to collect the unfulfilled Order.</p>

    <p>Repeated failure to fulfill confirmed Orders may lead to further corrective actions, including temporary suspension or termination of the Agreement.</p>

    <p>If the Partner becomes aware that any listed Goods are no longer available for sale (e.g. sold out, expired, or otherwise temporarily unavailable), the Partner must promptly update the availability status of those Goods on the Platform.</p>

    <p>In any event, the Partner shall mark such Goods as unavailable within ten (10) minutes of discovering their unavailability.</p>

    <p>Failure to comply with this obligation may result in incorrect Orders, Client dissatisfaction, or deductions as outlined in this Agreement.</p>

    <p>If the Platform has enabled a replacement functionality, the Partner may accept an Order that includes temporarily unavailable Goods only if:</p>

    <p>Suitable replacement items are available that closely match the unavailable Goods in type, quality, and value; and</p>

    <p>The Partner contacts the Client without undue delay to obtain explicit confirmation of the proposed replacement before proceeding with preparation or dispatch.</p>

    <p>The Partner must ensure that the Client is clearly informed of the nature of the replacement and consents to the change. Any substitution without Client approval may be considered a fulfillment failure and may trigger corrective actions under this Agreement.</p>

    <h3>ORDER PREPARATION</h3>

    <p>The Partner shall ensure that all Goods are prepared, handled, stored, and - where applicable - delivered in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations governing:</p>

    <p>Food hygiene and safety, including but not limited to requirements relating to time, temperature control, cross-contamination prevention, and allergen management;</p>

    <p>Consumer protection standards relevant to packaging, labeling, and traceability; and</p>

    <p>Any special handling or sales restrictions applicable to regulated or controlled Goods under local law.</p>

    <p>These obligations remain in force up to and including the point of delivery to the Client or direct handover by the Partner.</p>

    <p>The Partner accepts full and sole responsibility for ensuring legal compliance, and acknowledges that any breach may result in legal liability, platform penalties, or termination of this Agreement.</p>

    <p>The Partner shall ensure that all Orders are fully prepared and ready for pickup within the designated preparation time assigned to each Order on the Platform. The Order must be ready for pickup no earlier than within the last five (5) minutes of the allotted preparation timeframe, to ensure product freshness and minimize waiting time.</p>

    <p>In the case of self pick-up by the Client, the Partner must:</p>

    <p>Confirm the pickup by marking the Order as "Picked-Up" in the Platform interface; and</p>

    <p>Ensure that the Client has completed payment, where applicable, before finalizing the handover.</p>

    <p>Failure to meet preparation or pickup confirmation standards may result in deductions, client complaints, or other remedies as set out in this Agreement.</p>

    <h3>ORDER DELIVERY</h3>

    <p>If the Partner provides delivery services, it must mark the Order as "Picked Up" in the Platform as soon as the Order is collected by the Partner's employee or contractor for delivery.</p>

    <p>After the Partner's employee or contractor hands over the Order to the Client, the Partner must promptly mark the Order as "Delivered" on the Platform. This confirmation is required to complete the transaction and initiate any applicable payment processing or service-level tracking.</p>

    <p>If the Client fails to take possession of the Order (e.g., does not respond to calls or is unavailable at the delivery address), the Partner's employee or contractor must attempt to contact the Client at least three (3) times via the phone number provided on the Platform and remain at the designated drop-off location for a minimum of five (5) minutes. If the Client remains unreachable, the Partner must immediately contact the Platform's customer service to authorize cancellation of the delivery, charge the Client the full delivery fee, and receive further instructions regarding the handling of the Order.</p>
